### User Experience (UX)

#### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to learn about the different eras of fashion, understanding how fashion has evolved over time.
2. As a visitor, I want to view a gallery of images, read articles, and explore fashion trends.
3. As an enthusiast, I want to read famous quotes and contact for more information or newsletters through the contact form.

#### Design

##### Colour Scheme

- Primary Colours: A soft cream (#eff3bd) and coral (#ffb347) to create a vintage feel.
